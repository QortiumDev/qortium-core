# Design: I2P Fallback Transport for Qortium Core

Status: **Implemented on branch / pre-bundling validation complete** (2026-06-19)
Author: prepared with QuickMythril
Scope: Qortium Core networking (`org.qortium.network`), chain network + QDN data network

---

## 1. Problem & goal

On Previewnet every node connects only to the two public seed nodes: home routers
don't open inbound ports (UPnP fails — no IGD / CGNAT), so no ordinary node is
inbound-reachable, and the QDN data network (which has no peer-exchange of its own)
collapses to the seeds. UPnP, `minOutboundPeers`, and the reachability-advertise fix
(PR #45) help only nodes whose router cooperates; they cannot connect two NAT'd peers
to each other.

**Goal:** give NAT'd nodes a way to reach each other with no port forwarding, no new
seed/relay infrastructure, and no central coordinator — for **both** the chain network
(`Network.java`) and the QDN data network (`NetworkData.java`).

**Validated approach (spike, 2026-06-18):** an I2P overlay gives every node a routable
`.b32.i2p` address and carries data between two NAT'd nodes with zero open ports. A real
cross-NAT transfer succeeded (2 MiB, hash-verified). Throughput is modest and
warmup-sensitive (~28 Kbps avg, ~72–127 Kbps physical peaks, semi-warm), which is why
I2P is proposed as a **fallback transport**, not a replacement for direct TCP.

## 2. Principles (non-negotiables for this design)

1. **Direct TCP stays primary.** Public / port-mapped nodes keep using fast TCP. I2P
   carries only the traffic that otherwise has *no path* (NAT'd ↔ NAT'd).
2. **No new infrastructure.** No gateways, no relays, no seeds beyond what exists.
   Reachability comes from I2P itself, not from community transport nodes.
3. **Minimal, additive change.** Reuse Qortium's existing handshake, message, Peer, and
   selector machinery. Abstract only the connection-establishment and addressing seams.
4. **Decentralized.** Every node is equally reachable over I2P; no node is special.
5. **Incremental & reversible.** Ship behind a setting, data network first. There is no
   mainnet yet, so it is enabled across the board for testing; we un-adopt simply by not
   merging the branch if it doesn't pan out.

## 3. Key enabling insight: SAM turns I2P into SocketChannels

i2pd exposes the **SAM v3** API on `127.0.0.1:7656`. With SAM:

- `STREAM CONNECT ID=<sid> DESTINATION=<peer-b32>` — after the bridge replies
  `STREAM STATUS RESULT=OK`, **the same TCP socket becomes a transparent data pipe to the
  remote destination.** I.e. an outbound I2P connection is just a `SocketChannel` to
  `127.0.0.1:7656` that we hand to the normal peer machinery.
- `STREAM FORWARD ID=<sid> PORT=<localPort>` — the bridge opens a local TCP connection to
  `localhost:<localPort>` for **each inbound** I2P stream (prefixing the remote
  destination as the first line in SAM ≥3.2). So inbound I2P peers arrive as ordinary
  inbound `SocketChannel`s on a `ServerSocketChannel` we already know how to accept.

**Consequence:** the entire data path (selector loop, read/write tasks, handshake, message
framing, Peer state machine) is **reused unchanged**. New code is confined to: a SAM
session manager, an outbound "connect-over-SAM" helper, an inbound forward listener, and
I2P-aware addressing. This is the difference between this proposal (~hundreds of LOC) and
the Qortal `reticulum` branch (~7k LOC, see §11).

- **Per network, one I2P destination** (one SAM session): the chain network advertises its
  `.b32.i2p`, the data network advertises its own. (Two destinations mirror the two TCP
  ports; keeps the existing "separate networks" model intact.)
- A peer is reachable by **TCP and/or I2P**; the local node picks per-peer (see §5.5).

## 5. Component design

References below are to the current code, mapped by exploration on 2026-06-18.

### 5.1 I2P client library — decision

Three options were evaluated:

| Option | What | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Thin in-house SAM v3 client** (recommended for core) | ~300–500 LOC speaking SAM over `java.nio` to an external i2pd | zero new Maven deps; matches Qortium's thin-networking style; this is effectively what the spike validated | we maintain the SAM code; **requires i2pd present on the node** |
| B. `net.i2p:i2p` 2.5.1 | official lib; can **embed a Java I2P router in-process** | no external i2pd needed → far better UX for Qortium Home users; battle-tested | +~5 MB; full router in-process (RAM/CPU); heavier dep |
| C. Java RNS port (`jschulthess/reticulum-network-stack`) | full Reticulum stack | matches Qortal prior art | RNS has no working I2P interface (only an `i2p_tunneled` flag); pulls a large stack we'd use only as a socket wrapper |

**Recommendation:** implement transport against a small internal `I2PStreamProvider`
interface so the *backing* is swappable, and start with **(A) thin SAM client + external
i2pd** for core/dev. Treat **(B) embedded `net.i2p`** as the likely production answer for
Qortium Home (see §6 — the deployment/UX question dominates). The transport seam (§5.3)
is identical either way.

### 5.2 Addressing — `PeerAddress`

Today `PeerAddress` is a `host:port` string pair (`PeerAddress.java:18-167`).
`fromString()` (`:101-122`) validates IP *literals* via `InetAddresses.forString()` but
lets hostnames through; `toSocketAddress()` (`:138-148`) then does a DNS `InetSocketAddress`
lookup — which would **block/fail** on a `.b32.i2p` host.

Changes:
- Add a transport discriminator to `PeerAddress`: `enum Kind { IP, I2P }` (or `isI2P()`).
- For I2P, `host` holds the destination (`<52-char-b32>.b32.i2p`, ~60 chars), `port`
  unused (store `0` or the network's logical port for display).
- `fromString()` recognizes a `.b32.i2p` suffix → `Kind.I2P`, **skips** `InetAddresses`
  validation and never calls DNS.
- `toSocketAddress()` throws/`assert` for `Kind.I2P` (must not be called; the connect path
  branches before this — see §5.3).
- `equals()`/`toString()` already string-based, work for b32 (case-insensitive compare is
  fine; b32 is lowercase).

A `.b32.i2p` address is ~60 bytes, well within the `PEERS` message's 1-byte length field
(255) — so peer-exchange needs no wire change (§5.6).

### 5.3 Connection establishment — the transport seam

This is the only place the data path forks. Keep it narrow.

**Outbound** — `Peer.connect(int network)` (`Peer.java:714-751`) currently does
`SocketChannel.open()` + `socket().connect(resolvedAddress, CONNECT_TIMEOUT)` (`:721-723`).
Branch at the top:
```java
SocketChannel connect(int network) {
    PeerAddress addr = this.peerData.getAddress();
    SocketChannel channel = addr.isI2P()
        ? I2PTransport.forNetwork(network).connect(addr.getHost())  // SAM STREAM CONNECT
        : connectTcp(addr);                                         // existing path
    if (channel == null) return null;
    sharedSetup(network);   // unchanged: register with selector, non-blocking
    return channel;
}
```
`I2PTransport.connect(dest)` opens a `SocketChannel` to the SAM bridge, performs the
(blocking) `HELLO` + `STREAM CONNECT ID=<sid> DESTINATION=<dest> SILENT=false` handshake,
reads `STREAM STATUS RESULT=OK`, sets the channel non-blocking, and returns it. From that
point it is an ordinary data channel — `Network.connectPeer` (`Network.java:1568-1601`) and
the selector loop are unchanged.

**Inbound** — in addition to the existing `ServerSocketChannel` on 24892/24894
(`Network.java:297-302`, `NetworkData.java:281-285`), bind a **loopback**
`ServerSocketChannel` on an ephemeral local port and issue SAM `STREAM FORWARD
ID=<sid> PORT=<thatPort>`. i2pd then dials that local port for each inbound I2P stream.
Register it in the same selector; the accept path (`Network.java:1030-1038` →
`ChannelAcceptTask`, `ChannelAcceptTask.java:50,70`) is reused, with one variant: for the
forward listener, read SAM's leading destination line first and construct an I2P
`PeerAddress` instead of `PeerAddress.fromSocket()` (`:70`). The inbound `Peer` constructor
(`Peer.java:245-263`) caches `resolvedAddress` from the socket (`:256`) — for I2P that's
loopback and meaningless, so store the parsed I2P `PeerAddress` as the peer's address
instead.

**`I2PTransport` / SAM session manager (new, `org.qortium.network.i2p`):**
- Holds the persistent **control socket** to SAM and the `SESSION CREATE STYLE=STREAM`
  (one per network). The session's destination keys are loaded from / saved to disk so the
  node's `.b32.i2p` is **stable across restarts** (the spike confirmed RNS does this; we do
  it explicitly).
- Exposes: `String localDestination()` (our b32), `SocketChannel connect(String dest)`,
  and starts the `STREAM FORWARD` listener feeding the network's selector.
- Reconnect/health: re-establish the SAM session if the control socket drops (i2pd restart);
  surface "session up" state for reachability (§5.7).

### 5.4 Handshake — advertise our I2P destination(s)

Capabilities ride in the HELLO handshake as a free-form `Map<String,Object>`
(`Handshake.buildHelloCapabilities()`, `Handshake.java:558-583`; `HelloMessage`
`HelloMessage.java:17-21`; read via `Peer.getPeerCapability()` `:302-304`). This is exactly
how `"QDN":24894` is advertised — so we add string capabilities, no wire-format change:

- `"I2P"` → this node's **chain** destination b32 (when the chain I2P session is up).
- `"I2P_QDN"` → this node's **data** destination b32 (when the data I2P session is up).

Two keys because chain and data use separate destinations. A node advertises a key only
when that I2P session is up; absence = "no I2P here".

Because the SAM session can take 9-30s to build tunnels and publish a LeaseSet while a
clearnet handshake to seeds finishes in under a second, the first HELLO a NAT'd node sends
often carries no I2P key yet. `SamSession` therefore fires an `onSessionUp` callback the
moment the session comes up; `Network`/`NetworkData` re-send an updated HELLO (now carrying
the `"I2P"`/`"I2P_QDN"` key) to peers they already handshaked. A HELLO received after the
handshake has completed is treated as a capability refresh — `Handshake.applyPostHandshakeHello()`
re-checks chain identity and **merges** the advertised capabilities into the peer
(`Peer.mergePeersCapabilities()`) without touching handshake state or replying — so peers
learn the b32 immediately instead of waiting for connection rotation. Older nodes treat an
unexpected post-handshake HELLO as a protocol error and disconnect, so a node only re-advertises
to peers that announce the `"PHH"` capability (added to every HELLO); pre-`PHH` peers simply
pick up the destination at the next handshake/rotation.

### 5.5 Transport selection / fallback policy

When choosing how to reach a known peer:
1. If the peer is **directly IP-connectable** (we have a routable `IP:port` for it and it
   advertises inbound reachability) → **TCP** (fast path, unchanged).
2. Else if the peer advertised an I2P destination **and** local `i2pEnabled` and our I2P
   session is up → **I2P** (fallback).
3. Else → unreachable (as today).

Optional `i2pPreferred` setting forces I2P even when IP is available (useful for testing
and for privacy-conscious operators). The peer is *not* hard "transport-locked" (unlike the
Qortal branch); the local node decides per attempt, so a peer that gains a public IP later
is reached directly without re-handshake gymnastics.

### 5.6 Peer-exchange propagation

`PeersMessage` serializes addresses as `host:port` UTF-8 strings with a 1-byte length
prefix (`PeersMessage.java:19-48,61-83`). A `.b32.i2p` address fits (~60 < 255). A node that
is **not** directly IP-reachable advertises its I2P address in its self-entry so others can
reach it; `PeerAddress.fromString()` round-trips it via the `.b32.i2p` suffix detection
(§5.2). No new message type required for v1. (If we later want explicit transport tagging in
peer-exchange, `PeersV2Message` is the place — cf. how Qortal added `peerMetaType`.)

### 5.7 Reachability — `InboundReachability`

`canAcceptInbound()` (`InboundReachability.java:25`) currently gates *IP* direct-
connectability (`portMapped || hasConfiguredExternalAddress() || recentInboundHandshake`).
I2P reachability is independent: **if our I2P session is up, we are inbound-reachable over
I2P with no port mapping at all.** So:
- Track `i2pSessionUp` and expose `canAcceptInboundI2P()`.
- Advertise the `"I2P"`/`"I2P_QDN"` capability whenever the corresponding session is up,
  independently of `canAcceptInbound()` (IP).
- A node behind CGNAT with failed UPnP advertises *no* IP reachability but *does* advertise
  I2P — exactly the case we need to fix.

### 5.8 NetworkData (QDN) specifics

`NetworkData.addPeer()` (`NetworkData.java:2290-2347`) and `getConnectablePeer()`
(`:1223-1303`) learn data peers by taking the chain peer's `"QDN"` port capability and
**reusing the chain peer's host** (`:2319`) to build the data address. For I2P this is wrong
— the chain and data destinations differ. Fix:
- If the chain peer advertised `"I2P_QDN"`, build an **I2P** `PeerAddress` from that b32
  (ignore host:port reuse).
- Prefer a direct-IP QDN address when the peer is IP-connectable; else use `I2P_QDN`.

This is the change that makes cross-NAT **QDN fetch** work — the original symptom.

### 5.9 Settings (`Settings.java`)

New keys (defaults chosen for safe, opt-in rollout):
- `i2pEnabled` (bool, default `true` — no mainnet exists yet, so enable across the board for
  testing; gate it off per-node by setting `false`)
- `i2pPreferred` (bool, default `false`) — force I2P even when IP available
- `i2pSamHost` (default `127.0.0.1`), `i2pSamPort` (default `7656`)
- `i2pChainKeyFile`, `i2pDataKeyFile` (paths for persistent destination keys; default under
  the node data dir)
- `i2pEmbeddedRouter` (bool, default `false`) — if true and built with `net.i2p`, run an
  in-process router instead of requiring external i2pd (see §6)

## 6. Deployment / UX decision (must resolve before production)

The transport works with either an **external i2pd** or an **embedded Java router**. The
deciding factor is *who runs the node*:

- **Core / VPS / developers:** external i2pd is fine (and is what the spike used). Thin SAM
  client, zero deps. Document the i2pd install + the **local-file reseed** workaround for
  locked-down/Tor-centric hosts (see `~/AGENTS/notes.md` 2026-06-18 — default reseed servers
  were blocked on the Kicksecure dev box; `reseed.diva.exchange` su3 + `[reseed] file=` fixed
  it).
- **Qortium Home end-users (the whole point — ordinary NAT'd users):** requiring a manual
  i2pd install defeats the purpose. Either **Qortium Home bundles per-platform i2pd binaries**
  (like it already manages the Core), or Core **embeds `net.i2p`** so I2P "just works". This
  is a real fork in the road and should be decided in Phase 2a; my lean is embedded
  `net.i2p` for Home, external i2pd for headless/VPS, behind the same `I2PStreamProvider`
  seam so Core code doesn't care.

## 7. Phasing

- **Phase 2a — Data network over I2P: implemented.**
  SAM session management, outbound `STREAM CONNECT`, inbound `STREAM FORWARD`, `I2P_QDN`
  capability advertisement, direct-vs-I2P QDN peer learning, and data-peer transport
  selection are wired into `NetworkData`.
- **Phase 2b — Chain network over I2P: implemented.**
  The chain network now has its own SAM destination, advertises `"I2P"`, accepts forwarded
  I2P streams, learns I2P chain peer addresses from handshakes and PEERS messages, and can
  use I2P when direct TCP is unavailable or when `i2pPreferred` is enabled for testing.
- **Phase 2c — Reachability, settings, rollout: partially implemented.**
  Runtime settings, default-on I2P, API transport visibility, seed participation, and
  operator-level testing are in place. Remaining rollout work is mostly packaging and UX:
  either bundle/manage `i2pd` for normal users or add an embedded Java I2P provider behind
  the existing `I2PStreamProvider` seam.

## 8. Testing strategy

- **Completed unit/focused tests:** `PeerAddress` I2P parsing and no-DNS socket rejection,
  PEERS-message round-trip, HELLO capability serialization, chain/data capability
  advertisement, direct-vs-I2P peer learning/selection, duplicate/self I2P peer filtering,
  API transport labeling, I2P peer equality without DNS resolution, direct-primary replacement
  selection, I2P peer identity cache refresh after duplicate handshakes, and longer chain I2P
  retry backoff for stale destinations.
- **Completed live SAM integration:** opt-in tests bring up two `SamSession` instances
  against a live `i2pd`, forward inbound streams over loopback, exchange bytes over I2P,
  verify the forwarded remote destination, and confirm invalid `.b32.i2p` destinations fail.
- **Completed live Core validation:** two non-seed Previewnet nodes behind NAT established
  chain and QDN/data peer connections over I2P with no port forwarding. Forced-I2P testing
  confirmed both networks can use the fallback transport end to end.
- **Completed live fallback-mode validation:** with `i2pPreferred:false`, public seed
  connections can stay on direct TCP while non-reachable non-seed chain and data peers connect
  over I2P.
- **Implemented direct-primary recovery:** if a chain or QDN/data peer is temporarily reached
  over outbound I2P fallback and a known direct TCP address becomes eligible again, the node
  drops the I2P fallback so the existing dialer can retry TCP even when outbound peer slots are
  already full. Focused tests cover the replacement decision. Live Regxa/Netcup testing proved
  this behavior for the QDN/data network: the seeds were forced onto completed I2P data peers,
  then returned to direct TCP after the fixed data addresses were restored. A controlled local
  two-node chain lab also proved the chain-network drop branch: node A held a completed outbound
  chain I2P peer to node B, a cached direct TCP route to node B became eligible again, and node A
  logged the expected `Dropping I2P fallback peer ... so direct TCP peer ... can be retried`
  disconnect. Final non-loopback validation then proved the complete chain recovery path using a
  local disposable proof node and a temporary Netcup proof node on the public chain port while
  Regxa stayed online as the live seed. The local node first completed a direct TCP handshake to
  Netcup and learned the same node's I2P destination, then forced an outbound I2P chain fallback,
  disabled preferred I2P, and reintroduced the direct address. Core dropped the completed I2P
  fallback with the same `Dropping I2P fallback peer ... so direct TCP peer ... can be retried`
  path and then completed a direct TCP handshake to the same Netcup node ID.
- **Completed real QDN payload validation:** Netcup deleted its local cache for
  `JSON/Native/qhelp.feedback.v1.p.mqkcfj5406253a6t6o`, rebuilt it to 100%, and the active
  non-seed I2P data peer's `lastAccessed` timestamp advanced during the rebuild. This proves
  real QDN payload traffic over the I2P data path, not only data-peer handshaking.
- **Completed recovery/regression validation:** restarting the remote `i2pd` while Core was
  running left Core synced and the SAM sessions recovered. Netcup's user-local `i2pd` was also
  restarted after SAM refused connections, and Core recovered chain/data I2P sessions without a
  Core restart. Regxa recovered its QDN/data SAM destination after its user-local `i2pd` process
  was replaced under a running Core, preserving the same `.b32.i2p` address. Running the remote
  node with `i2pEnabled:false` kept chain/data peers on TCP and removed I2P/I2P_QDN capabilities
  from its direct handshakes.
- **Completed stale-I2P retry validation:** stale chain destinations that fail after SAM stream
  setup now use the longer I2P retry backoff. Live logs showed the stale `q25q...b32.i2p`
  destination retrying after roughly 15 minutes instead of the normal two-minute TCP failure
  backoff.
- **Completed stale-handshake cleanup:** chain and QDN/data schedulers now disconnect stale
  non-completed handshakes directly instead of waiting only for the slower controller prune
  cycle, and outbound I2P handshake timeouts count as outbound failures for backoff. Focused
  tests cover old outbound I2P `HELLO` peers on both networks. After deployment to Netcup and
  Regxa, the follow-up seed test did not leave another lingering I2P QDN/data `HELLO`: Netcup
  restored a direct QDN/data peer to Regxa, and the temporary I2P data lookup failed cleanly at
  the SAM layer with `LeaseSet not found`.
- **Cross-NAT:** the two-machine setup from `~/reticulum-spike/CROSS-NAT-SETUP.md`, but with
  Core instead of `rncp`.
- **Regression:** existing TCP-only tests must pass unchanged with `i2pEnabled:false`.

## 9. Rollout

- Current branch behavior uses an external `i2pd` SAM bridge. The release zip does not yet
  bundle `i2pd` or an embedded router, so preview testers who want I2P fallback must install
  and run `i2pd` locally with SAM enabled on `127.0.0.1:7656`.
- Bundle decision per §6 into the production packaging path later (ship/manage an `i2pd`
  binary from Qortium Home, or add a `net.i2p` embedded provider behind the same seam).
- Preview configs inherit `i2pEnabled:true` and the SAM defaults from `Settings.java`;
  existing testers pick up untouched keys through normal settings-template merge behavior,
  while local overrides still win.
- Seeds keep public IPs (TCP primary) and additionally run I2P, so they can also serve
  unreachable peers over I2P during transition.
- No mainnet exists yet, so `i2pEnabled:true` across the board (preview/testnet/defaults);
  the whole effort lives on a branch and simply isn't merged if it doesn't pan out.

## 10. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| I2P throughput modest (~tens of Kbps–low Mbps) | It's a **fallback**; TCP carries reachable peers. QDN already fetches chunks from multiple peers in parallel, so slow I2P links add capacity, not a bottleneck. |
| i2pd not present on user machines | §6 — bundle i2pd with Home or embed `net.i2p`. |
| i2pd reseed blocked on hardened/locked-down networks | Document local-file reseed (`reseed.diva.exchange` su3); embedded router can ship a seed set. |
| SAM session lifecycle (i2pd restart drops session) | Session manager reconnects; peers re-handshake; b32 persists via saved keys. |
| Destination-key file is sensitive | Store under node data dir with restrictive perms; never commit; rotate-able. |
| Added attack surface / privacy | Gated by `i2pEnabled` (settable off per node); no mainnet yet, so on across the board for testing; document threat model. |
| Cold-start latency (I2P tunnels take minutes) | Acceptable for a fallback; persist destination + known-peer hints to warm faster. |

## 11. Alternative considered: full Reticulum (Qortal `reticulum` branch)

The closest prior art (Qortal `reticulum` branch, `~/reticulum/repos/Qortal/qortal`) takes a
**maximal** approach: full Java RNS (`jschulthess/reticulum-network-stack` via JitPack), a
parallel `RNS.java` (~1,978 LOC), `Peer`/`PeerAddress` refactored to interfaces +
reflection factories (`@PeerCtor`/`@PeerAddressCtor`), `IPPeer`/`ReticulumPeer`, and
**transport-locked** peers — **57 files, +7,276/−2,107 LOC**. Its shipped config relies on
**Backbone/TCP gateway servers** (`reticulumBackboneGatewayServers`,
`reticulumTcpGatewayServers`), i.e. reachable RNS transport nodes — which **reintroduces the
relay-infrastructure dependency this design avoids** (RNS routes through transport nodes; it
does not hole-punch).

**Why not adopt it wholesale:** (a) it's a large, invasive rework on a codebase that has
diverged from Qortium; (b) its decentralization depends on community gateways we don't want
to run; (c) it gives RNS features (mesh routing, LXMF) we don't need for the NAT problem.

**What to borrow:** the *structural* ideas if/when we want true multi-transport — the
`PeerAddress` interface split and a peer/transport factory are cleaner than a `Kind` enum at
scale. If a future requirement is "general Reticulum mesh" (not just NAT traversal),
revisit this branch as the base. For *now*, the thin SAM-fallback design (§3–§9) solves the
actual problem with ~1–2 orders of magnitude less change.

Reusable references (reticulum branch): `RNS.java`, `ReticulumPeer.java`,
`ReticulumPeerAddress.java`, `PeerFactory.java`/`PeerAddressFactory.java`,
`reticulum_config_template.jinja`.

## 12. Decisions (locked 2026-06-18)

1. **Library/deployment:** build against a swappable `I2PStreamProvider` seam; **start with a
   thin SAM client + external i2pd** for dev/testing. Embedded `net.i2p` for Qortium Home
   remains a later option behind the same seam (revisit during Phase 2a packaging).
2. **`PeerAddress`:** minimal **`Kind` enum** (`IP`/`I2P`), not the interface split.
3. **I2P destinations:** **two** — separate chain and data destinations, mirroring the two
   networks/ports.
4. **Posture:** no mainnet exists yet → **enabled across the board** (`i2pEnabled` default
   `true`). The work lives on branch `i2p-fallback-transport` and is simply not merged if it
   doesn't pan out.

## 13. Implementation status & handoff (2026-06-18)

**Branch:** `i2p-fallback-transport` in `/home/user/git/qortium`, created off
`work/restore-feature-triggers` and later brought forward with the current `main` history.
Do a final sync/rebase onto `main` before any PR.

**Done on this branch:**
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/network/i2p/I2PStreamProvider.java` — the transport seam (SAM
  now; embedded `net.i2p` possible later behind the same interface).
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/network/i2p/SamSession.java` — thin SAM v3 client (persistent
  Ed25519 destination, `.b32.i2p` derivation, `connect()`, inbound `STREAM FORWARD`,
  `PING`/`PONG` keepalive). Compiles clean. SAM exchange + b32 derivation validated against
  the live i2pd (SAM v3.1). `SESSION CREATE`/`STREAM CONNECT` are slow (tunnel build) → 120 s
  setup timeouts baked in.
- `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/i2p/SamSessionIntegrationTests.java` — opt-in live i2pd
  tests (`-Dqortium.runLiveI2PTests=true`) that bring up two SAM sessions, forward inbound
  streams over loopback, exchange bytes over I2P, verify the forwarded remote destination, and
  check that an invalid `.b32.i2p` destination fails.
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/network/PeerAddress.java` — now carries `Kind { IP, I2P }`,
  recognizes valid `.b32.i2p` hosts, keeps I2P ports at `0`, skips IP/DNS validation for I2P,
  and rejects socket/DNS conversion for I2P addresses.
- `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/PeerAddressTests.java` and
  `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/message/PeersMessageTests.java` — cover IP/DNS
  compatibility, `.b32.i2p` normalization/rejection, no-DNS socket conversion, and PEERS
  message round-trip for I2P addresses.
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/settings/Settings.java` — adds enabled-by-default I2P settings,
  SAM host/port, separate chain/data key paths, the future embedded-router toggle, writable
  setting support, and restart-required validation.
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/network/Handshake.java` — advertises `I2P` and `I2P_QDN` only
  when the corresponding local I2P session is up while preserving existing numeric
  capabilities such as `QDN`.
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/network/NetworkData.java` — starts the data SAM session
  asynchronously, opens the local loopback `STREAM FORWARD` listener, accepts forwarded I2P
  peers without blocking the selector thread, learns direct and `I2P_QDN` data addresses from
  chain handshakes, keeps direct TCP primary, and uses I2P as a fallback (or as preferred only
  when `i2pPreferred` is enabled).
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/network/Network.java` — starts the chain SAM session
  asynchronously, opens the chain `STREAM FORWARD` listener, accepts forwarded chain peers,
  learns and exchanges I2P chain peer addresses, skips local/duplicate connecting I2P peers,
  and keeps direct TCP primary unless `i2pPreferred` is enabled.
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/network/Peer.java` — branches outbound connects for chain and
  data I2P peers, preserves forwarded I2P peer addresses instead of loopback bridge
  addresses, and compares I2P peer identity without DNS resolution.
- `src/main/java/org/qortium/api/model/ConnectedPeer.java` and
  `src/main/java/org/qortium/api/model/ConnectedDataPeer.java` — expose a simple
  `transport` field (`IP` or `I2P`) for active chain and data peers.
- `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/HandshakeTests.java`,
  `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/message/HelloMessageTests.java`, and
  `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/NetworkDataI2PTests.java` — cover I2P capability
  advertisement/serialization and direct-vs-I2P QDN peer learning/selection behavior.
- `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/NetworkI2PTests.java` and
  `src/test/java/org/qortium/network/PeerTests.java` — cover chain I2P learning/selection,
  PEERS-message propagation, and peer equality behavior for I2P addresses.

**Validated:**
- I2P gives NAT-free cross-NAT reachability — a cross-NAT file transfer was received intact;
  throughput was ~28 Kbps avg / 72–127 Kbps physical peaks (semi-warm), so it is
  fallback-grade, not primary.
- Live Java SAM integration tests proved two `SamSession` instances can exchange bytes over
  live `i2pd`, and invalid destinations fail.
- Live Previewnet testing with forced I2P proved two non-seed nodes can establish both chain
  and QDN/data peer connections over I2P with no port forwarding.
- Live fallback-mode testing with `i2pPreferred:false` proved the same non-seed path can stay
  on I2P while public seed paths use direct TCP when those direct paths are active.
- Live QDN payload testing rebuilt `JSON/Native/qhelp.feedback.v1.p.mqkcfj5406253a6t6o` from
  50% to 100% on Netcup while the non-seed I2P data peer was active; that I2P peer's
  `lastAccessed` timestamp advanced during the rebuild.
- Live recovery testing confirmed SAM sessions can recover after `i2pd` restart/failure:
  the NAT'd test node recovered chain/data sessions after a remote `i2pd` restart, and Netcup
  recovered chain/data sessions after its user-local `i2pd` was restarted while Core remained
  running. Regxa also recovered its QDN/data SAM destination after its user-local `i2pd` process
  was killed and replaced under a running Core; the replacement session reused the same
  `hg3...b32.i2p` destination.
- Live TCP-only regression testing with `i2pEnabled:false` kept the remote node on direct TCP
  only and removed I2P capabilities from its direct handshakes.
- Public seed nodes keep direct TCP as the preferred path when reachable, while also
  advertising I2P destinations for fallback-capable peers.
- Focused chain and QDN/data tests cover selecting an outbound I2P fallback for disconnect
  when a known direct TCP replacement is eligible again.
- Live QDN/data direct-primary drop validation succeeded with Regxa and Netcup: both public
  seeds were forced onto completed I2P data peers, then moved back to direct TCP after the fixed
  QDN/data addresses were restored.
- Stale I2P handshake cleanup has focused test coverage and is deployed on both public seeds.
  The post-deploy seed test did not reproduce the lingering I2P data `HELLO`; Netcup stayed on
  direct QDN/data TCP to Regxa while the temporary I2P data lookup failed cleanly at the SAM
  layer.
- Local regression validation after the cleanup passed `mvn -q -Dtest=NetworkI2PTests,NetworkDataI2PTests,PeerAddressTests,PeerTests,HandshakeTests test`,
  `mvn -q -DskipTests package`, and `mvn -q test`.
- Live chain direct-primary drop validation succeeded in a controlled local two-node lab: node A
  held a completed outbound I2P chain peer to node B, then dropped that fallback when the cached
  direct TCP route became eligible again. The lab used a loopback `socat` forwarder for the direct
  route, so final TCP replacement did not stick: node B detected the forwarded `127.0.0.1` address
  as a self-connection and closed the handshake. That leaves only final non-loopback chain TCP
  replacement proof, not the direct-primary drop branch itself, for any further live validation.
- Final non-loopback chain direct-primary validation succeeded on 2026-06-19. The test used a
  disposable local proof node and a temporary Netcup proof node on the public `24892` chain port;
  the real Netcup seed was stopped only for the duration of the controlled proof, while Regxa
  stayed online and synced. The local proof node first completed a direct TCP handshake to Netcup
  and learned the same peer's `I2P` capability, then forced a completed outbound chain I2P peer to
  that same Netcup node ID. After `i2pPreferred` was set back to `false` and the direct
  `185.207.104.78:24892` address was reintroduced, Core logged `Dropping I2P fallback peer ... so
  direct TCP peer 185.207.104.78:24892 can be retried`, disconnected the completed I2P fallback,
  and completed a direct TCP handshake to the same Netcup node ID. Netcup's normal seed service was
  restored afterward and verified listening on `24891`, `24892`, and `24894` with live peers.

**Environment (this dev box is Kicksecure — read `~/AGENTS/` first):** i2pd installed +
running, SAM on `127.0.0.1:7656`, console `http://127.0.0.1:7070`, `bandwidth = X`. **i2pd
reseed on this box works ONLY via the local-file method** (`[reseed] file =
/var/lib/i2pd/i2pseeds.su3`); default/URL/Tor-proxy reseed all fail here — do not revert it.
`apt` / `/etc/i2pd` edits / `systemctl` need the `sysmaint` account. `rns 1.3.5` (pipx) and
spike artifacts are in `~/reticulum-spike/` (incl. `CROSS-NAT-SETUP.md` for a second machine)
and `~/.reticulum-a|-b`. Reference clones (Java RNS, qortal reticulum branch, markqvist
Python) are in `~/reticulum/repos/`.

**Next steps, in order:**
1. Decide the end-user deployment model before broad release: Qortium Home managed `i2pd`
   binaries or an embedded Java I2P provider behind `I2PStreamProvider`.
2. Final PR prep: sync/rebase onto `main`, run the broader test/package suite, review the
   total diff for local paths/debug settings/stale docs, then open the PR.

**Gotchas:** `pkill -f <pattern>` matches the running shell when the pattern is in its own
command line (kill by filtered `ps` instead). i2pd must be `active` for any I2P test —
check the console `Routers` is in the hundreds. SAM stream ops are slow on a cold router.

## 14. Production fix: SAM session recreate churn / LeaseSet publication (2026-06-20)

**Symptom.** I2P-only nodes (and freshly (re)started nodes) could sit at zero I2P
connections despite the SAM session reporting "up". Remote nodes dialing such a node
got `STREAM STATUS RESULT=CANT_REACH_PEER` with `LeaseSet not found`: the node was not
publishing a LeaseSet, so nothing could reach it inbound over I2P. Self-bootstrap from
the seeds over I2P therefore failed even though everything looked configured correctly.

**Root cause — recreate churn against a not-yet-released destination.** `SamSession.close()`
drops the SAM control socket, but `i2pd` takes tens of seconds to actually tear down and
release that destination's tunnels. If Core opened a *new* SAM session for the **same
persisted destination** during that window (any teardown→recreate cycle: retry, restart
shortly after stop, etc.), `i2pd` attached the new session to the dying destination,
built **no** inbound tunnels, and published **no** LeaseSet — yet returned
`SESSION STATUS RESULT=OK` immediately. Because the session looked OK, Core kept using
it, kept failing, and kept recreating — a self-sustaining churn (~21 recreates in one
observed run) that never published a LeaseSet.

This was confirmed live with a standalone SAM probe against the same `i2pd`, using a
freshly generated throwaway destination (never touching Core's keys):

- **A — first `SESSION CREATE`:** ~30–50 s (real tunnel build); destination appears in
  i2pd's local destinations with established inbound tunnels → **published**.
- **B — `close(A)` then immediate recreate of the same destination:** `SESSION CREATE`
  returns in ~0 s; destination is **absent** from local destinations, no inbound
  section → **not published** (the zombie).
- **C — wait a cooldown (75 s) then recreate:** ~30–50 s again, established inbound
  tunnels → **published** once more.

So a real session build is always slow (it must build tunnels); a near-instant
`SESSION CREATE OK` for a persisted destination is the tell-tale of a zombie attach.

**Fix (`SamSession.java`).** Two cooperating guards, both keyed by the destination's key
file so the chain and data destinations are tracked independently:

1. **Per-destination recreate cooldown.** Before `SESSION CREATE`, wait out
   `DESTINATION_REUSE_COOLDOWN_MS` (90 s) since that destination's last teardown, so
   `i2pd` has fully released it and a fresh create builds real tunnels and publishes.
   `close()` records the teardown timestamp (only when it actually held the control
   channel).
2. **Zombie detection by timing.** Time the `SESSION CREATE`. A real build never returns
   in under `MIN_REAL_SESSION_BUILD_MS` (5 s); a faster "OK" is treated as a failed,
   unpublished setup — Core throws so the caller rebuilds, then the cooldown ensures the
   rebuild waits for the destination to release. This second guard also **self-heals the
   restart case**: the cooldown map lives in the JVM, so after a process restart it
   starts empty and the cooldown alone can't catch a too-soon recreate — but the timing
   check still flags the instant-OK zombie and forces a proper rebuild.

The SAM-level `SESSION REMOVE` approach was considered and dropped: it is not valid SAM v3
for these non-primary sessions, and the cooldown + timing guards address the cause directly.

**Validation.** After the patch, a node reliably published its LeaseSet (observed inbound
tunnels climbing 5 → 8 → 10), a remote `STREAM CONNECT` returned `RESULT=OK`, and the
**I2P-only local node bootstrapped from the seeds over I2P and reached SYNCED** — the
end-to-end goal that the churn had been blocking. This also closes the practical side of
F1 ("cold seed LeaseSet"): the seeds now keep a published LeaseSet, so NAT'd nodes can
fall back to them over I2P.

**Rollout lesson.** Do not build Core on a low-RAM seed: a Maven build there OOM-killed the
host's `i2pd` (taking I2P down mid-rollout). Build the jar elsewhere and copy it to the
seed, or skip the copy entirely when the change is config-only and the jar is functionally
identical.

## 15. LeaseSet hardening: pinned session options + publication self-check (2026-06-21)

Two follow-ups to §14 that stop a node from *believing* it is inbound-reachable over I2P
when its LeaseSet is not actually published. Both live in `SamSession.java`.

**Pinned `SESSION CREATE` options (`SESSION_OPTIONS`).** The session previously inherited
whatever tunnel/leaseset defaults the local `i2pd` happened to use, which varies by router
version and can yield a LeaseSet some remote routers cannot encrypt to. We now append a fixed
set of SAM v3 `KEY=VALUE` options to the `SESSION CREATE` line:

- `i2cp.leaseSetEncType=4,0` — publish a LeaseSet that offers both ECIES-X25519 (type 4) and
  legacy ElGamal (type 0) encryption, so any-vintage remote router can reach us;
- `inbound.quantity=3 outbound.quantity=3` with `inbound.backupQuantity=1 outbound.backupQuantity=1`
  — redundant tunnels so the destination keeps a stable, continuously-published LeaseSet rather
  than flapping when a single tunnel expires;
- `inbound.length=2 outbound.length=2` — standard 2-hop tunnels.

**Publication self-check (`verifyLeaseSetPublished`).** §14's timing guard catches the
instant-OK zombie, but a destination can still report `SESSION STATUS RESULT=OK` after a real
tunnel build yet lag (or fail) LeaseSet publication. After the session reports up, Core opens a
transient SAM control connection and issues `NAMING LOOKUP NAME=<ourB32>`, retrying a few times
(publication can trail the tunnel build by seconds):

- `RESULT=OK` → the destination resolves through the netDB → LeaseSet published → proceed.
- Repeated non-`OK` resolution failures (e.g. `KEY_NOT_FOUND`) → treat as unpublished and throw,
  so the caller rebuilds. This deliberately **reuses** the §14 cooldown + zombie guards
  (`close()` records the teardown; the next `start()` waits out the cooldown) rather than
  bypassing them.
- The check is **best-effort and non-fatal**: if SAM cannot perform the lookup at all
  (`INVALID_KEY`, an unparsable reply, or no clean SAM exchange), Core keeps the session instead
  of tearing down something that may be working.

**Honest logging.** The "reachable at" lines in `Network`/`NetworkData` (and the `SamSession`
up-log) overstated reachability: they fired as soon as tunnels were built. They now say
control/tunnels are up and that inbound reachability depends on LeaseSet publication; the
`SamSession` up-log additionally reports `LeaseSet published` only after the self-check passes
(or is skipped as unsupported).
