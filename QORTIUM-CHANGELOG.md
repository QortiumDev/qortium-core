# Qortium Change Log

This is the main human-readable record of the Qortium fork effort.
It is written for non-developers first, with the goal of making each change
easy to follow without reading code.

## What Qortium Is

Qortium is the working name for a stripped-down and cleaned-up fork of Qortal
Core.

The aim is to keep the parts that are useful as a starting foundation while
reducing inherited complexity, removing project-specific assumptions, and
making the codebase easier for other teams to understand and adapt into their
own chain.

## Early Goals

- keep the history clean and easy to read
- make each logical change its own commit
- explain every meaningful change in plain language
- separate Qortium-specific direction from upstream Qortal messaging
- turn stable architectural decisions into tracked documentation over time

## How To Use This File

- update this file with every intentional Qortium commit
- use one entry per commit
- make each entry title match the commit message exactly
- keep each entry to one combined plain-language description
- keep entries understandable to non-developers
- use this file as the public narrative of the fork, alongside the technical
  git history

## Change Entries

### 2026-04-19 - network: move initial peers into settings

Changed Qortium so the initial peer list now comes from an optional
`initialPeers` array in `settings.json` instead of shipping built-in Qortal
seed nodes, which keeps first-run and bootstrap-created peer lists under the
operator’s control while still preserving the existing behavior of only seeding
peers when the local peer database is empty.

### 2026-04-19 - core: disable automatic bootstrap by default

Changed Qortium so automatic bootstrap recovery is off unless an operator
explicitly turns it on and provides bootstrap hosts in `settings.json`,
removed the built-in upstream bootstrap host defaults, made missing-host
bootstrap requests fail immediately instead of entering a broken retry path,
and kept the inherited manual/bootstrap path available only when someone has
deliberately configured it.

### 2026-04-19 - core: disable automatic updates by default

Changed Qortium so automatic updates are off unless an operator explicitly
turns them on and provides update mirror URLs in `settings.json`, which stops
the fork from shipping upstream Qortal update endpoints as defaults while still
leaving the inherited manual opt-in update flow available until a better
Qortium-specific update process is designed.

### 2026-04-19 - docs: add Qortium changelog baseline

Added the main human-readable Qortium change log, documented what Qortium is
and what the early goals of the fork are, and set the basic rule that each
future Qortium commit should add one plain-language entry that matches the git
commit message so people can follow the project history without reading code.
